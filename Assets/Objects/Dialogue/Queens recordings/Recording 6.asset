    Text: We may have found a way to fix our energy crisis.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: Myrion stars.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: These stars produce hyperlumen energy.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: Just a small amount of this energy could power the empire for days.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: All space travel, from henceforth, shall be to gather as much of this energy
      as possible.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: Around a Myrion star we shall set up colonies on their planets.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: These colonies will gather the energy in containers where they will then
      be shipped back to our world.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: Today is a new era for the Thexrian empire.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: From the tops of the snowy Garall mountains to the shallow Oldtide waters
      and all across the Thexrian empire, I am wishing you a Glorious Day!
