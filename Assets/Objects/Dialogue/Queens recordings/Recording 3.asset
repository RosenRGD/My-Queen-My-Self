  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: My children, it is time we have a discussion about the recent concerns
      regarding energy.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: As you all know Thexorian dominance has been achieved in large part thanks
      to technology that accelerates the growth of my brood.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: However, the resources used to power that technology is running out.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: We are looking for new ways to gather that power.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: But currently there aren't any signs.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: However, I promise to you, my children, as your Queen, I will find a solution.
  - Speaker: Queen
    Text: From the tops of the snowy Garall mountains to the shallow Oldtide waters
      and all across the Thexrian empire, I am wishing you a Glorious Day!
